# ESTEEM

Electronic Structure Tool for Energy Estimation of Molecules (ESTEEM) is a MATLAB tool for calculating molecular orbitals and energies for small systems using either restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) or restricted Kohn-Sham density functional theory (RKS-DFT).  This work is the result of an in-class project for CHEM565: Computations in Chemistry at the [University of Washington](uw.edu).
